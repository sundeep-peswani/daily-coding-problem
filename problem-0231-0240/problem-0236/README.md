This problem was asked by Nvidia.

You are given a list of `N` points (`x`<sub>`1`</sub>, `y`<sub>`1`</sub>), (`x`<sub>`2`</sub>, `y`<sub>`2`</sub>), ..., (`x`<sub>`N`</sub>, `y`<sub>`N`</sub>) representing a polygon. You can assume these points are given in order; that is, you can construct the polygon by connecting point `1` to point `2`, point `2` to point `3`, and so on, finally looping around to connect point `N` to point `1`.

Determine if a new point `p` lies inside this polygon. (If `p` is on the boundary of the polygon, you should return `False`).
